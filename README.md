# Obsidian Tiff Viewer

This plugin creates copies of all `.tif(f)` files in the currently opened file and converts them to `.tif(f).png` where ever they are saved. This allows for `tif(f)` images to be displayed in obsidian. 

## Functionality

The plugin consists of 3 commands.

- `Tiff viewer: Convert .tif(f) to .png`
    - Creates a copy of all files in the current editor 
- `Tiff viewer: Delete all .tif(f).png in vault`
    - deletes all files in the vault, that end on **.tif(f).png**
- `Tiff viewer: Convert all .tif(f).png to .tif(f) in the editor`
    - Renames all **.tif(f).png** file links in the opened editor back to **.tif(f)**
